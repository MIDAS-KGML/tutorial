# From Data to Discovery: Applying Computer Vision for Scientific Image Analysis with Vascilia + Napari

Author: [Yasmin Kassim](https://github.com/Yasmin-Kassim)

Join Yasmin Kassim for an immersive session that bridges cutting-edge deep learning with biological discovery. She will unveil VASCilia‚Äîa powerful Napari plugin designed for 3D analysis of cochlear hair cell stereocilia bundles‚Äîhighlighting the challenges of real-world biological datasets and the five deep learning models powering the platform, including Z-Focus Tracker,  PCPAlignNet, 3D instance segmentation, region prediction, and tracking. In the second half, Yasmin will lead a hands-on coding workshop, guiding participants through building their own interactive Napari plugin‚Äîcomplete with data loading, segmentation (traditional and ML-based), instance filtering, measurement export, and UI design. Ideal for anyone passionate about scientific computing, imaging, and elegant toolmaking.

## üîç Tutorial Descriptions

This tutorial will provide a practical understanding of:
- What Napari is
- How to install and use it
- How to design and implement your own interactive plugin

Participants will learn how to:

- Set up a Napari plugin interface
- Create buttons to load and segment data (using traditional methods and machine learning)
- Perform instance segmentation
- Delete un-desired objects
- Calculate and export measurements
- Build a basic UI and exit workflow
