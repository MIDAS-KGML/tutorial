This agent is responsible for\n","1. steering the conversation by choosing which agent speaks when\n","2. terminating the conversation.\n","\n","In order to implement such an agent, we need to solve several problems.\n","\n","First, to steer the conversation, the `DirectorDialogueAgent` needs to (1) reflect on what has been said, (2) choose the next agent, and (3) prompt the next agent to speak, all in a single message. While it may be possible to prompt an LLM to perform all three steps in the same call, this requires writing custom code to parse the outputted message to extract which next agent is chosen to speak. This is less reliable the LLM can express how it chooses the next agent in different ways.\n","\n","What we can do instead is to explicitly break steps (1-3) into three separate LLM calls. First we will ask the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to reflect on the conversation so far and generate a response. Then we prompt the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to output the index of the next agent, which is easily parseable. Lastly, we pass the name of the selected next agent back to `DirectorDialogueAgent` to ask it prompt the next agent to speak.\n","\n","Second, simply prompting the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to decide when to terminate the conversation often results in the `DirectorDialogueAgent` terminating the conversation immediately. To fix this problem, we randomly sample a Bernoulli variable to decide whether the conversation should terminate. Depending on the value of this variable, we will inject a custom prompt to tell the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to either continue the conversation or terminate the conversation."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"id":"pn8kMMs2Jyo0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754358268056,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Changwen Xu","userId":"17643067088135531548"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["class IntegerOutputParser(RegexParser):\n","    def get_format_instructions(self) -> str:\n","        return \"Your response should be an integer delimited by angled brackets, like this: <int>.\"\n","\n","\n","class DirectorDialogueAgent(DialogueAgent):\n","    def __init__(\n","        self,\n","        name,\n","        system_message: SystemMessage,\n","        model: ChatAnthropic(model=os.environ[\"LANGSIM_MODEL\"], api_key=os.environ['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY']),\n","        speakers: List[DialogueAgent],\n","        stopping_probability: float,\n","    ) -> None:\n","        super().__init__(name, system_message, model)\n","        self.speakers = speakers\n","        self.next_speaker = \"\"\n","\n","        self.stop = False\n","        self.stopping_probability = stopping_probability\n","        self.termination_clause = \"Finish the conversation by stating a concluding message and thanking everyone.\"\n","        self.continuation_clause = \"Do not end the conversation.
